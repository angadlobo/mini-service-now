# Mini ServiceNow

A full-featured, self-contained IT Service Management (ITSM) platform inspired by ServiceNow. Built for teams that need ticketing, workflow automation, asset management, knowledge base, and AI-assisted operations -- all running from a single `docker-compose up`.

**Stack**: Node.js / Express / TypeScript, PostgreSQL, React / Vite / TypeScript, Mantine UI, Docker

---

## What Is This?

Mini ServiceNow is an open-source ITSM platform that replicates the core functionality of enterprise tools like ServiceNow, Jira Service Management, and Freshservice. It includes:

- **Incident Management** -- Track and resolve IT issues with priority matrices, SLA enforcement, and state machines
- **Change Management** -- Plan, approve, and implement changes with risk assessment and approval workflows
- **Release Management** -- Group changes into coordinated deployment packages with scheduling, risk scoring, rollback tracking, and a release calendar
- **Problem Management** -- Identify root causes across related incidents with investigation workflows
- **CMDB / Asset Management** -- Track configuration items, relationships, and impact analysis
- **Service Catalog** -- Self-service portal with dynamic request forms and approval routing
- **Knowledge Base** -- Searchable articles with rich text editing and publish workflows
- **Workflow Automation** -- Event-driven rules that auto-assign, notify, and update records
- **AI Integration** -- Configurable AI assist (OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, or any custom provider) for summarization, resolution suggestions, risk assessment, and more
- **Form Builder** -- Drag-and-drop custom forms with field validation
- **Reporting & Export** -- Build custom reports and export to CSV
- **Webhooks / Integrations** -- Push events to external systems with retry logic
- **Notifications** -- In-app, email (SMTP), and Slack notification channels
- **Role-Based Access Control** -- Admin, ITIL, User, Approver, and Knowledge Manager roles

Everything is configurable through the admin UI -- no code changes needed to add AI providers, configure SMTP, set up webhooks, or create workflow rules.

## Quick Start (Docker)

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed

### Run it

```bash
git clone <repo-url> mini-service-now
cd mini-service-now
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```

Wait for the containers to start (the server runs all database migrations and seeds automatically on first boot), then open:

**[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**

### Default Login

| Username | Password |
|----------|----------|
| `admin` | `admin123` |

Log in with `admin` / `admin123` to get full access to all features.

---

## All Demo Accounts

|---|---|---|---|
| `admin` | `admin123` | Admin | Everything -- manage users, configure AI, workflows, settings |
| `itil.user` | `itil123` | ITIL | Create/manage incidents, changes, problems, KB articles |

You can also register a new account from the login page (self-registration is enabled by default).

---

## Installation Options

### Option 1: Docker (Recommended)

**Development mode** (hot reload on code changes):
```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up --build
```

**Production mode**:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

| Service | URL |
|---------|-----|
| Client (React) | [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) |
| Server (API) | [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) |
| PostgreSQL | `localhost:5432` |

### Option 2: Local Development (without Docker)

**Prerequisites**: Node.js 20+, PostgreSQL 14+

**1. Set up the database**
```bash
psql -U postgres -c "CREATE USER msn_user WITH PASSWORD 'msn_password';"
psql -U postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE miniservicenow OWNER msn_user;"
psql -U postgres -c "GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE miniservicenow TO msn_user;"
```

**2. Configure environment**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env if your PostgreSQL settings differ
```

**3. Start the server**
```bash
cd server
npm install
npm run dev
```
The server runs migrations and seeds automatically on startup. API at `http://localhost:3001`.

**4. Start the client**
```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Architecture

### Table-Driven Engine
Each module registers its table with the `tableRegistry`, defining columns, states, and transitions. This enables generic CRUD, state machine validation, and polymorphic journal/attachments/audit/approvals (all keyed by `table_name + record_id`).

### Event Bus
All record creates, updates, and state changes emit typed events. The workflow engine, webhook dispatcher, and integration providers listen to these events and react automatically. The `integration.inbound` event type enables workflows to trigger on external events received from provider webhooks.

### Integration Provider System
A pluggable provider abstraction layer (`IntegrationProvider` abstract class) enables first-class integrations with external tools. Each provider defines its auth method, config fields, inbound webhook verification, and workflow actions. The `providerRegistry` singleton manages all registered providers and enables the workflow engine to delegate provider-specific actions automatically. OAuth2 flows use transient state sessions stored in the database with popup-based client authorization.

### Authentication
- JWT access tokens (15 min) stored in memory
- Refresh tokens (7 days) in httpOnly cookies
- Passwords hashed with bcrypt (12 rounds)
- RBAC middleware: `requireRole('admin')`, `requireRole('itil', 'admin')`
- Self-registration with configurable feature flag

### AI Engine
- Provider adapters for OpenAI, Anthropic, Ollama, and any custom OpenAI-compatible API
- API keys encrypted at rest (AES-256)
- Prompt templates with `{{variable}}` interpolation
- Usage logging with token counts and user feedback

### SLA Engine
- SLA definitions match records by condition (e.g., `{ priority: 1 }` -> 60 min)
- SLA instances track start time, planned end, and breach status
- Automatically applied on incident creation, completed on resolution

---

## Seed Data

The application seeds itself on first startup with:

- 5 roles, 11 users (admin, ITIL agents, end users, approvers, managers), 4 assignment groups
- 20 demo incidents across all states and priorities (INC1001-INC1020) with journal entries
- 10 demo changes with approvals, affected CIs, and linked incidents/problems (CHG1001-CHG1010)
- 3 demo problems linked to incidents and changes
- 5 CI types, 16 CIs with relationships (servers, switches, load balancer, SAN, WAF, AD, Citrix, print server)
- 4 catalog categories, 10 catalog items with dynamic form variables, 8 requests across all states
- 5 KB categories, 15 KB articles (published + draft) covering networking, security, software, and policies
- 7 workflow rules with triggers, webhooks, and scheduled runs (auto-assign, escalate, notify, auto-close, Slack alerts)
- 11+ workflow executions with action logs for workflow monitoring dashboard
- 6 change templates (3 standard pre-approved, 2 normal CAB-required, 1 emergency)
- 3 maintenance windows (weekly, monthly, quarterly) and 2 blackout windows
- 3 CAB meetings with agenda items, votes, and meeting minutes
- 4 change approval rules (by risk level, change type, and impact)
- 7 reports with 3 scheduled report deliveries (incident, change, asset, problem reports)
- 6 AI prompt templates (ready to use once a provider is configured)
- 3 notification channels (in-app, email, Slack)
- 2 form templates (Employee Onboarding, Change Request Intake) with 4 submissions
- 15+ approval records across changes and catalog requests
- Journal entries on incidents, changes, and problems, 4 SLA definitions
- 6 integration providers (GitHub, Jira, PagerDuty, Teams, Datadog, Grafana) with sample configs
- 7 integration links connecting external resources to incidents, changes, and problems
- Sample integration delivery logs for inbound and outbound events
